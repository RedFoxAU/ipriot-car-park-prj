# üöó Car Park Management System

This project simulates a smart car park system using object-oriented design principles. 
It supports managing vehicle entry and exit, logging events, displaying availability, and saving/loading configuration using JSON.

## üìÅ Overview

This system is developed in Python and models a real-world car park with the following features:

- Track vehicles entering and exiting
- Live display of available bays
- Event logging to `log.txt`
- Save and load configuration using `config.json`
- Sensor-triggered entry/exit
- Fully test-driven development (TDD) workflow


## ‚úÖ Features

- `CarPark` class manages all vehicles and components
- `Sensor` classes trigger vehicle entry and exit
- `Display` shows messages and updates in real-time
- Configurable via `config.json` file
- Logs activity with timestamps using `log.txt`


## üß™ Testing


Run tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

```bash
python src/main.py
```
